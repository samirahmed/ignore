# Ignore

### Why? Its the easiest way to fetch gitignores 

I got irritated making repos then manually fetching gitignores. So I made this.

- easy updates from [github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
- you can add your own gitignores to your ~/.ignores directory
- even comes with zsh autocompletion

### How to Install? 

```
> gem install ignore
> ignore update
```

##### Autocompletion

just copy the zsh autocomplete function to wherever your autocomplete functions go (it depends on your config)

### Make it Better

Heres the todo list

- Autoupdate
- better docs
- Custom remotes for your own gitignores (i have no need for this)
